# [[SPICE]] limitations

All variants of [[SPICE]], at their most basic level, solve equations representing the behavior of electronic circuit elements based on [[Kirchhoff]]â€™s current and voltage laws by means of [[nodal point analysis]]

- Kirchhoff's [[current law]]
- Kirchhoff's [[voltage law]]
