For any analogue simulation (including the [[DC analysis]]) there is a **zero reference potential required** (for the nodal analysis). 

The **ground symbol** can be found in the Components tab in the lumped components category. The user can also choose the ground symbol icon or simply press the `Ctrl+G` shortcut. In the given circuit in [[divider.png]] the ground symbol is placed at the negative terminal of the [[источники#Vdc источник напряжения]] source.
