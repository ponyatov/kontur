**Git Semantic Versioning** is a methodology for versioning software releases. It is based on the Semantic Versioning Specification ([[#SemVer]]), which is a document that outlines the rules for versioning software releases.

## SemVer
### Semantic Versioning Specification

**SemVer** defines three version numbers: 
- **major**,
	- increment when there are *backward-incompatible* changes
- **minor**
	- increment when new *backward-compatible* functionality is added
- **patch**
	- increment when backward-compatible *bug fixes* are added
