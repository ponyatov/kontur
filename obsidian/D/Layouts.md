# Layouts

To show several widgets in window, you have to use group widgets, e.g. layouts to arrange them.

DlangUI apps usually don't use fixed layouts with manually pixel-precision placed elements. To support different DPIs and scalability, Layouts are being used.

Layouts in [[DlangUI]] are similar to layouts in [[Android/Android|Android]] or [[Qt/Qt|Qt]]

Commonly used layouts:

- [[VerticalLayout]] - arranges children vertically
- [[HorizontalLayout]] - arranges children horizontally
- [[TableLayout]] - arranges children in several columns
