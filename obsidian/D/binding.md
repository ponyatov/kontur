# [[D/D|D]] binding

https://derelictorg.github.io/bindings/

> Typically, the **binding** by define provides a **one-to-one mapping to the original interface**.

For example, the 
- names of all type and function declarations in the a binding
	- correspond exactly to those declared in the original C libraries, 
	- except in cases where the original API uses a variable or type name that is a keyword in D.

Bindings are sometimes mistakenly referred to asÂ [[wrapper|wrappers]].
