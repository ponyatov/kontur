[[dfmt]] uses [[EditorConfig]] files for configuration. If you run dfmt on a source file it will look for `.editorconfig` files that apply to that source file. If no file is specified on the command line, [[dfmt]] will look for `.editorconfig` files that would apply to a D file in the current working directory. Command line options can be used instead of .editorconfig files, or to override options found there.
