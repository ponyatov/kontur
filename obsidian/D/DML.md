# DML
## [[DlangUI]] Markup Language

https://github.com/buggins/dlangui/wiki/Getting-Started#loading-layouts-from-dml

Manual creation of widgets in code is boring.

There is more convenient way to create complex layouts - using DML strings.

DML stands for DlangUI Markup Language, and it's similar to [[QML]] used in QtQuick.

Pass string with DML to parseML function to create layout according to your definition.
