## short

The puzzle [[Game/Black Box]], “simulates shooting rays into a black box to deduce the locations of “atoms” hidden inside.” Gameplay takes place using a grid and by selecting rows and columns to “shoot rays” through. With each shot, a ray can pass through to the other side, hit an atom, or reflect off in a different direction. Each ray and subsequent output provides clues to where the atoms lie. The objective, of course, is to figure out where the atoms are.
