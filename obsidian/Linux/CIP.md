# [[Linux/Linux|Linux]] CIP
## Civil Infrastructure Platform

https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/civilinfrastructureplatform/start

The Civil Infrastructure Platform (CIP) aims to establish a “base layer” of **industrial-grade tooling** using the [[Linux/kernel]] and other open source projects. This base layer will be available for use by developers creating software building blocks that meet safety, security, reliability and other requirements that are critical to industrial and civil infrastructure projects.

## Core

​a set of industrial-grade components that require ​super **long-term maintenance**

https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/civilinfrastructureplatform/cip-core

CIP core has two profiles:

- The tiny profile is built from Debian source code and is useful for devices with storage restrictions, extreme performance and flexibility requirements, and low-complexity applications.
    
- The generic profile is built from Debian binary packages and covers devices that require more functionality, have less performance and flexibility requirements, and more storage.
