> **FAI** is a tool for unattended mass deployment of [[Linux/Linux]]. It’s a system to install and configure Linux systems and software packages on computers as well as virtual machines, from small labs to large-scale infrastructures like clusters and virtual environments. You can take one or more virgin PC’s, turn on the power, and after a few minutes, the systems are installed, and completely configured to your exact needs, without any interaction necessary.
