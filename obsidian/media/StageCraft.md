https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StageCraft

StageCraft is an on-set virtual production visual effects technology composed of a [[video wall]] designed by [[Industrial Light n Magic]] (ILM). Initially developed for the [[Disney]]+ series **The Mandalorian**, it has since been used in other productions and has been cited as a revolutionary visual effects technology. The [[sound stage]] in which StageCraft is implemented is called [[The Volume]].

The [[StageCraft]] process involves shooting live-action actors and sets surrounded by large, very high-definition LED [[video wall]]s. These walls display [[CGI|computer-generated imagery]] backdrops, once traditionally composited primarily in post-production after shooting with green screens. These facilities are known as "volumes". When shooting, the production team is able to realign the background instantly based on moving camera positions. The entire [[CGI]] background can be manipulated in real-time.

ILM used [[Epic Games]]' [[Unreal Engine]], a popular [[game/engine]], to handle real-time [[3D rendering]] of computer-generated imagery environments. Other technology partners in [[StageCraft]] include [[FuseFX]], [[Lux Machina]], [[Profile Studios]], [[nVidia]], and [[ARRI]].

In September 2020, it was announced that a second permanent volume was being created at [[Manhattan Beach Studios]] in [[Los Angeles]], in addition to the first built for The Mandalorian, which was expected to be completed in March 2021; one at [[Pinewood Studios]] in [[London]], to open in February 2021; and a larger, custom one at [[Fox Studios]] [[Australia]]. These new volumes would be larger, use more LED panels, and offer higher resolution than the original Manhattan Beach one. [[ILM]] also has the ability to provide "pop up" virtual production configurations in other locations. A volume was announced to be built in [[Vancouver]] in November 2021, and was planned to be opened in early 2022.
