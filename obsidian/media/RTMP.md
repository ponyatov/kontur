# RTMP
## Real-Time Messaging Protocol
### vs [[media/RTSP]]

communication protocol for streaming audio, video, and data over the Internet.

Originally developed as a proprietary protocol by [[Macromedia]] for streaming between [[media/Flash#Player]] and the [[media/Flash#Communication Server]], [[Adobe]] (which acquired Macromedia) has released an incomplete version of the specification of the protocol for public use.

The RTMP protocol has multiple variations:
- **RTMP proper**, the "plain" protocol which works on top of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and uses port number 1935 by default.
- **RTMPS secure**, which is RTMP over a Transport Layer Security (TLS/SSL) connection.
- **RTMPE encripted**, which is RTMP encrypted using Adobe's own security mechanism. While the details of the implementation are proprietary, the mechanism uses industry standard cryptographic primitives.[1]
- **RTMPT over hTTp**, which is encapsulated within HTTP requests to traverse firewalls. RTMPT is frequently found utilizing cleartext requests on TCP ports 80 and 443 to bypass most corporate traffic filtering. The encapsulated session may carry plain RTMP, RTMPS, or RTMPE packets within.
- **RTMFP over udP**, which is RTMP over User Datagram Protocol ([[UDP]]) instead of [[net/TCP|TCP]], replacing [[net/RTMP#Chunk Stream]]. The Secure Real-Time Media Flow Protocol suite has been developed by [[Adobe#Systems]] and enables end‚Äêusers to connect and communicate directly with each other ([[p2p]]).
